title: What Makes Us Human
---

I’ve worked in the technology sector for over a decade. As the world changed and shifted underneath our feet, we found that trust, humanity, and privacy have taken a back burner in the way we build and think about technology. With looming threats of misinformation, data leaks and abuse, and policy mishaps that fracture your customer base, it is more important now to have the right advocates by your side.

Without intention, your customer experience is fractured and disparate; causing frustration, anger, and resentment. Solving this goes beyond product management and user research, it requires your organization to center it’s relationship among users. Intentionally Human is about keeping your customers at the center of your product, policy, and infrastructure; building those as one holistic solution.

As a Principal Privacy Consultant, I know the work it takes to both build from the ground up or to transform an organization over years. Privacy is just the beginning; we are witnessing a culture shift in the industry that focuses on the relationship we want to have with technology. It requires a combination of strong company values, a dedication to change, and the right expertise by your side.

We can build technology to be more human, authentic, and kind. Let us show you how.
