# Technology Ethics and Privacy Impact Assessments

Our team has spent their careers focusing on building technology for everyone. We bring a customer-centric, technologically nuanced approach to impact assessments to bring a holistic perspective on product and organizational risk. Whether you are designing a risk program from scratch or need supplementary expertise, we are here to help.  

# Privacy Program Development

The bread and butter of privacy and technology ethics, privacy programs are key to building the organizational muscle memory to preserve trust and respect for users. Your privacy program often manages customer trust across the entire organization. We can help you craft a program that works with your business and helps keep your customers first. We take an immersion-based approach where we understand how your organization functions and recommend practices, processes, tooling, and training that is tailored to your needs.

# Technical Design and Implementation

Risk-conscious software is hard to build and maintain; with over a decade of experience under our belt, we can work with your in-house teams to build solutions that protect customers throughout the software development lifecycle. By taking a human-by-design approach, we build privacy and respect as essential components to technology. Let us work with you to build systems that mitigate risk and bring delightful, empathetic experiences to your customers.
